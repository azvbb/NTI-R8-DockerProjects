# Text Submission App Using Flask

This is a simple web application that allows users to submit text, which is then saved in a text file on the server. This project uses **Flask** for the backend, **HTML** and **CSS** for the frontend, and **Docker Compose** for easy deployment with separate containers for frontend and backend services.

# Hostname Writing with Shared Volume

This project demonstrates how multiple Docker containers can interact through a shared volume. Each container writes its hostname to a shared volume, allowing data sharing between containers. One container lists the contents of the shared volume to display all hostnames written by other containers.
